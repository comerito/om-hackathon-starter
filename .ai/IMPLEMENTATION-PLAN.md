# HackOn Platform — Implementation Plan

**Source spec:** `.ai/specs/SPEC-001-2026-03-17-hackon-platform.md`
**Created:** 2026-03-17
**Convention:** Each step ends with a working application. Check the box when done.

---

## Step 0 — Directory Structure & Module Registration
> **Goal:** Create all 7 module directories with full OM anatomy. Register in `src/modules.ts`. Run `yarn generate` to verify discovery. App compiles and starts.

### 0.1 Create module directories

```

### 0.2 Populate stub files

Every module gets:
- `index.ts` — metadata (name, title, version, description)
- `acl.ts` — empty features array `export const features: string[] = []`
- `setup.ts` — empty setup `export const setup: ModuleSetupConfig = {}`
- `events.ts` — empty events config
- `data/entities.ts` — empty
- `data/validators.ts` — empty
- `backend/page.tsx` — placeholder "Module coming soon" page
- `i18n/en.json` / `pl.json` — empty `{}`

### 0.3 Register modules in `src/modules.ts`

Add before the `example` module entry:
```typescript
{ id: 'competitions', from: '@app' },
{ id: 'tracks', from: '@app' },
{ id: 'teams', from: '@app' },
{ id: 'projects', from: '@app' },
{ id: 'judging', from: '@app' },
{ id: 'sponsors', from: '@app' },
{ id: 'incidents', from: '@app' },
```

### 0.4 Verify

- [ ] `yarn generate` — completes without errors
- [ ] `yarn dev` — app starts, no module discovery errors
- [ ] Backend sidebar shows 7 new module placeholder pages

**Status:** `[x] Done` — committed `4d01fe6`

---

## Step 10 — Teams: Track Selection & Stage Lockdown
> **Goal:** Team owner selects track. Advancing to HACKING locks team membership. Unmatched participants handled.

### Deliverables

- Stage preview endpoint now returns real data: unmatched participants count, under-sized teams count, teams without tracks
- Backend: disqualification/withdraw flow on team detail page
- Backend: "assign to team" admin action on participant management page

### Verify
- [ ] Team owner can select track → track assigned, members notified

- Backend: flag/unflag actions, submission progress bar (submitted/total)
- Portal: submit button with deadline check, post-deadline disabled message

### Verify
- [ ] Team owner can submit project → DRAFT→PUBLISHED
- [ ] Submission rejects if required fields or disclosure missing
- [ ] Published project locked for edits

- Integration tests: stage advance side effects (per spec §18)
- Unit tests: score calculation, vote limit, stage transition validation, Zod config validators
- Dry run mode: `GET /api/competitions/:id/stage-preview` returns accurate predictions
- Final polish: loading states, flash messages after actions, progress indicators

### Verify
- [ ] Full lifecycle E2E test passes
- [ ] Integration tests pass for all stage transition side effects
- [ ] Unit tests pass for scoring, voting, validation
- [ ] Stage preview returns accurate predictions
